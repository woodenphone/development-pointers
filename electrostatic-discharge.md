# ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD)
## Summary
* TODO: Paragraph on what it is - electrical potential between points, energy discharging between differently charged items.
* TODO: Paragraph on why we care about it - ESD induced damage to  components - manifests in many forms - intermittent faults, deviation from component spec even for passives, complete failure of component - intermittent faults most insidious, followed by deviation from spec, with complete failure of component at least being realtively easily detectable.

* TODO: Paragraph on mitigations.
Plain cardboard tends to be a good option for a cheap work surface that
* TODO: Pink (chemical treated) vs silver (metallized conductive) bags; why silver is usually better for the job.

* TODO: Paragraph on: detecing ESD. KV ranges associated with physical effects.

* TODO: Paragraph on: Circuit design - ground planes, exposed grounds, insulation,  protection circuits - reference grounds on SATA, SAS, m.2 connector etc. - diode clamping - dedicated protection and isolation components e.g. optocouplers / USB protection chips, level shifters even maybe.
