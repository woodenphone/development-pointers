### Quest / TWINE (Text adventures)
* Can use 7zip to extract `.quest` file as zip archive of files, revealing the `.aslx` script that is the game along with other included game files such as images and sounds (on windows).
* Some games have weblinks instead of including image files in the `.quest` file, requiring extra steps to preserve the whole game. Consider `grep  | wget` pipes to extract embed links and download them to a local dir.
