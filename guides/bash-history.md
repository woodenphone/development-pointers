# Bash history (remembering previous commands)
Bash includes various options to configure it's builtin history.


* TODO: Write this.
* TODO: Copypaste in files and docs.

## Recommendations
Backup history file before making history config changes
```bash
cp -v ~/.bash_history ~/".bash_history.$(date +%Y-%m-%dt%H-%M-%S%z).backup"
```

In-memory history size is generally fine being some low number like 500.
`export HISTSIZE="500"`

History file lines is better set to something very high or to be unlimited.
Controlled by: `HISTFILESIZE`

Configure bash to append commands to history immediately so they get reliably saved to file.
`export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; $PROMPT_COMMAND" ## Keep per-pane runtime history, but immediately update historyfile as commands are run.`


Set a timestamp string for the history file so that you can know when you ran a command.
`export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z $ " # line prefix format (format string for strftime)`

Permit duplicate entries so that you can better see what you were doing in what order.
`export HISTCONTROL="" # Retain all commands.`

Always set bash to append to history file, to tolerate multiple shell sessions being open at once. 
`shopt -s histappend # Append to history file, for multi-session history handling.`
