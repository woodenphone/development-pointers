# Licensing 
`Oi m8, you got a loisence for that treaty-restricted munition?`
Basic software licensing for independant developers.


## Overview of licensing
* TODO: Software licensing vs non-software licensing.

* TODO: Make recommendations of licenses to use.



## Licenses


### Open source licenses


### Proprietary licenses
* TODO: Windows - various editions.
* TODO: Shareware example.
* TODO: Freeware example.
* TODO: AMD / Intel firmware.
* TODO: Texas instruments inc. ITAR compliance BS.


### Esoteric and interesting licenses
Less common but interesting and often noteworthy as useful examples to keep interest up.


#### Plus nigger license AKA '+NIGGER'
Amusingly requires continued inclusion of a taboo word as a license condition. A rather humorous act of rebellion against censorship and corporate types.

## Codes of Conduct (COCs) - (Office politics)
I strongly suggest avoiding these if at all possible.
If you cannot avoid using one take efforts to minimize the scope of what it covers and the powers granted.
These tend to just serve as a way for petty office politics to leak into projects.
COCs tend to be an invasion vector for hostile actors to usurp projects, whether for ideological dominance or classic powertripping or whatever.
These tend to foreshadow projects going pear shaped within a few years.
Sqlite is liekly the best counter-example; and even then, theirs is rebelling against silly demands to add complexity to project maintenance.

* Just put the development first and use basic professionalism to focus on improving the codebase.

### Wikipedia 
Don't trust wikipedia for anything remotely controversial, nor expect good explainations when they think they can break out the extended mathematical definitions; but wikipedia is an okay way to get an idea of what to read up on next.
e.g. You can trust them about what the more common SATA and SAS connectors look like, but not about journalistic integrity.

Software licensing is combo if contract and copyright AFAIK.

Topics to explain: (already daunting)
```
copyright
patent
trademark
trade secret
contract
Non-Disclosure-Agreements
precedents
common-law vs. non-common-law jusrisdictions
jurisdictions
etc.
```

`If you are dumb enough to blindly follow instructions from some random guy you don't know without validating anything at all then you are kind of asking to get fucked with.`
