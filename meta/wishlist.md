# Wishlist
Thing that should be done, but need getting around to doing for that to happen.
i.e. the single repo-wide todo list.



* TODO: Download all linked material to prevent it vanishing entirely;
* TODO: Come up with a nice format for citing/referencing PDFs and other saved materials, including `(title, date, filename, filesize, hash)` information.


* Search for string `TODO` and work through results.
* Search for string `TODO` and collect results into a single list with each entry referencing its origin.

* Fix licenses on files.
* Copy in more examples.
* Dedupe examples
* Merge any instances of multiple documents on the same subject.
* Collect together all links of powershell scripting to a `powershell-links.md` file.

* Merge/copy in my previous documentation and notes from 2024 and earlier.
* Links to other similar things to this repo in a `webring.md` or something file
* Better central index of files and what they are.
* Complete unfinished documents.
* Verify all the code actually works as intended.
* Critical feedback and revision/improvement based on such; goal of being useful as a starting point and refresher for newbies and experts alike.
* More esoteric and fun things.
* Git actions
* Examples of utilizing github/gitgud site features
* More unified markdown formatting for reliable presentation and readability; without going full retard, of course.
* Most-harmless possible malware that's still obvious - to teach users not to blindly run code. Maybe `youare.swf` as a shell script?
* Automate document conversions ala pandoc
