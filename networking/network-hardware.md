# Network hardware
## Summary of basic advice
* The sweet spot for home LAN stuff is Cat6a, which can take 10Gbit/sec over moderate runs.
* Basic tier wired ethernet as of 2025 is 1Gbit/sec; only buy netetworking hardware less capable than this if you know you need it for specific oddball / legacy cases.
* Wireless will basically never be as good as wired for anything other than not needing a cable - wlan is slower and less reliable than comparable wired due to physics.


## Consumer vs enterprise hardware
* TODO: Just how much more does a homelan get from the more expensive networking gear?
